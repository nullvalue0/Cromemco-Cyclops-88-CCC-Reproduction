This is an attempt to reproduce the PCB's for the Cromemco Cyclops digital camera, the 2-disk board 88-CCC. The original digital cameras are basically impossible to find. Thankfully there has already been a (reproduction effort for the camera itself)[http://wsudbrink.dyndns.org:8080/cyclops/index.html].

The next missing piece then would be the controller boards. While a few of the 88-CCC's have turned up, they are mainly already in collectors hands and still very rare. In several years of trying to find them I haven't been able to nab a set.

With the (Dazzler boards already successfully reproduced)[https://forum.vcfed.org/index.php?threads/cromemco-dazzler-replica-project.77906], this seems like a great next project. I'll update this readme as the project progresses.
