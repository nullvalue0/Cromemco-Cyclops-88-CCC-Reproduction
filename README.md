This is an attempt to reproduce the PCB's for the Cromemco Cyclops digital camera, the 2-disk board 88-CCC. The original digital cameras are basically impossible to find. Thankfully there has already been a [reproduction effort for the camera itself](http://wsudbrink.dyndns.org:8080/cyclops/index.html).

The next missing piece then would be the controller boards. While a few of the 88-CCC's have turned up, they are mainly already in collectors hands and still very rare. In several years of trying to find them I haven't been able to nab a set.

With the [Dazzler boards already successfully reproduced](https://forum.vcfed.org/index.php?threads/cromemco-dazzler-replica-project.77906), this seems like a great next project. I'll update this readme as the project progresses.

The 'Original Images' folder contains pictures of the original board set that I've found on various sites.

The 'Original Schematics' folder contains the original manual & schematics for the 88-CCC. I've combined the 2-page schematic into a single image for each board, making it much easier to reference.

The PCB folder will contain the reproduction Kicad files & gerbers for both S-100 boards.
